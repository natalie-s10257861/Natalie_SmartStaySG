# Project Overview
This is a self initiated data analytics and machine learning project I've undertaken that focuses on Singapore's hospitality and tourism industry. It combines hotel revenue forecasting, guest sentiment analysis and tourist market segmentation to provide actionable intelligence for Singapore's Hospitality industry.
This project is built entirely built using Singapore-sourced data from data gov and real TripAdvisor hotel reviews from Kaggle, and addresses key industry problems through data analytics and machine learning (Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.) I've also uploaded the report on my analysis into his repository as well, you can download Natalie_SmartStayReport.docx for the full project analysis on word doc (don't open it using vscode)

# Industry Problems
Key challenges faced by Singapore's Hospitality Industry that I've identified:
1. Demand volatility: fluctuation of occupancy can be seen drastically due to events (e.g F1, CNY), seasonality, and recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Service quality blind spots: hotels lack data-driven insight into guest pain points across specific service dimensions
3. Untargeted marketing: tourist source markets have vastly different travel behaviours, yet often receive the same marketing approach

# Composition of my project
Two main pipelines were being used:
1. Tourist Market Segmentation & Forecasting: clustering countries and predicting visitor arrivals
2. Hotel Review NLP Analysis: sentiment classification and topic modeling on 60,680 reviews

# How to run on vscode
1. Clone and Setup
- git clone
- cd smartstay-sg
- pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Download all the datasets and rename them accordingly
- "hotel_monthly.csv": "https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_1db0bd2ffd95ac09c66db600e60d3400/view",
- "hotel_by_tier.csv":     "https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_8da6783d5f7628ae6ada1c240015b7d7/view",
- "visitor_arrivals.csv":  "https://data.gov.sg/datasets?query=International+Visitor+Arrivals+by+Country+&resultId=1622",
- "hotel_annual.csv":      "https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_a728577abbe4ff3f3409b9129be28a53/view",
- "tourism_receipts.csv":  "https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_e285a651ec353416054195528ca988a9/view",
- "tripadvisor_sg.csv":
  "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrisgharris/tripadvisor-singapore-reviews",
- "tourism_receipts_qtr.csv": "https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_248d4c6574b5ac87cd31851ed3f697d6/view"

3. Run Notebooks in order
- Setup_and_Download.py — installs dependencies and downloads the raw data
- Load_and_Clean.py — loads and cleans the raw data
- Merge_and_Features.py — merges datasets and engineers features (creates the country profiles, lag variables)
- Clustering.py — runs K-Means segmentation on the tourist market data
- Forecasting.py — trains and evaluates the Ridge/XGBoost/ arrival forecast models
- Sentiment.py — runs TF-IDF vectorisation, trains classifiers, LDA topic modelling, and pain point analysis
- Launch_Dashboard.py — launches the final interactive dashboard
